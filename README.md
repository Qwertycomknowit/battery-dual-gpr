🔍 Overview

Monitoring and predictive modeling of lithium-ion battery performance are critical for advancing energy storage technologies.

This study employs a Dual Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) framework to model both State of Health (SOH) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) using indirect health indicators (IHIs) derived from voltage, current, and temperature data in the NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE) Lithium-ion Battery Dataset.

Among the three predictive models evaluated, Model 3 achieved the highest accuracy:

✅ RMSE (SOH): 0.0040

✅ MAE (RUL): 12.4499 (Battery B0005)

By integrating capacity degradation with indirect health indicators, Model 3 offers a robust and reliable framework for battery prognostics.
